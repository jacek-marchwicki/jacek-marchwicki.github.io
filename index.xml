      <description>During the development of a chat app, I had to implement some kind of lock logic. Usually, locking/unlocking code is hard to follow. If complex business logic uses complicated locking, your code becomes unreadable and unmaintainable. However, there is a pattern that can help you writing readable locking/unlocking code.</description>
